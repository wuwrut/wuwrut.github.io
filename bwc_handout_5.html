<h1>Roades' Field Notes</h1>

<p>There is a cave in the hills that Roades considers to be of great archaeological significance. The notes contain a sketch map that shows the cave's location. As the notes progress, he starts referring to it as a holy site.</p>

<p>Roades has had discussions with Sheriff Sprouston, who also believes that the cave is holy. Roades does not trust Sprouston's motivations, though.</p>

<p>His wife, Abigail, has had an accident at the cave and is trapped there. </p>

<p>In the later notes, Roades occasionally refers to Abigail as his mother.</p>

<p>One note mentions that Abigail is the source of the newly revived creek.</p>

<p>Roades believes the water has special properties. In the later part of the journal, he refers to it repeatedly as "The Water of Life".</p>

<p>In the last pages, Roades talks about how the voice of his mother, Abigail, is in his head conscantly now. He seems alternately comforted and terrified by this. </p>

<p>And it was from the secret tome of Richard Duncan that I learned the secret of everlasting life. 
The process is a drastic one but we worth the oasts, I believe.  Cooperation from the servants will also be necessary...</p>

<p>I have found a drug which I will administer to Jamison and Henrietta. In regular doses it will steadily repress their wills.
Once under the influence of the drug, they will be subject to my commands, spoken to them from the other side.
I have also begun construction of the equipment necessary for the transformation. 
I've hired the blacksmith in Hamton to do the heavier work. Someone will have to be hired to install the gas equipment...</p>

<p>The cellar is ready. I feel my time is drawing near. The money has been securely hidden in the floor of the basement workshop.
This journal I shall place in my study. Once the transformation is complete, I will have to move fast.
It would do no good for me to have achieved a new life only to be connected with what they will find in this house after the reading of the will.</p>

<p>The subtle poison I have prepared is ready. Jamison and Henrietta have had their last instructions. The time is now. </p>

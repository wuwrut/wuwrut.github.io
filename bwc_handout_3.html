<h1>From Indian Tribes of the Northeast</h1>
<h3>by Nathaniel Chapman</h3>

<p>Of all the peoples of the Miskatonic Valley, the most mysterious and feared was the Sicaiook tribe, known to the white settlers as the Children of the Black Earth. They have not been seen since Colonial days, but stories of them still live on in folklore. While some
 of the stories of the Sicaiook no doubt have their basis in fact, many have doubtless been embellished by the passage of time or tainted by native superstition.</p>

<p>The assertion that the tribe would conduct raids and take captives who they would then offer up as sacrifices to their great spirits is richly plausible. While human sacrifice among the Indian peoples is a rarity, the evil reputation and reported depravity of the Si
caiook was the cause of their shunning by all neighbouring tribes, and these tales of murder simply form part of this tapestry. Their ferocity and bloodlust is also the most likely root of the reputation of their warriors as never dying on the battlefield and being imm
une to all mortal weapons. </p>

<p>Where their legend becomes pure fancy is in the detail of the tribe being ruled by an undying council of elders, who were never seen outside their sacred cave. The elders were spoken of as wise and terrible, with great magic and gifts of healing. Similarly fantastic
 is the description of the tribe as "brothers to snakes and to the vermin of the field".</p>

<p>No stories or legends survive to explain the disappearance of the tribe, but the most likely explanations remain that they were either exterminated by either their neighbours or Colonial settlers, or that exposure to civilising influences led to their acceptance and
 absorption into the larger tribes of the valley. </p>

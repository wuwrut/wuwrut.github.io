<h3>Ancient Dagger Stolen</h3>

<p>University staff are today shocked at the discovery of a break-in at the campus museum.
Last night a thief stole into the building and took one of the exhibits: a dagger believed to be of Native American origin.</p>

<p>The dagger has been on display as part of the History of the Miskatonic Region exhibit, which has excited many young
school children with its wide array of fascinating pieces for the last twelve months.
The dagger is one of the few artifacts pertaining to Arkham's tribal heritage.</p>

<p>Dr. August Perplinski, noted local historian, commented that the dagger is a rare example of a shamanistic ritual tool,
possibly used by a tribal witch doctor to help them journey into the spirit realm.</p>

<p>In a bizarre and unexpected twist, the Arkham Police Department has confirmed that a second theft also
took place on the University Campus last night. Across the Campus Square, the Library Building's Rare Book Collection was ransacked.</p>

<p>So far officials have only been able to confirm the theft of one item from the Library, an ancient scroll written in Greek,
concerning mathematical formulae.</p>

<p>Mr. Pringler, a spokesman for the University, confirmed that a reward of $100 had been posted
for anyone providing information leading to the capture of thieves and the retum of the stolen items.
Police have requested that anyone with information should come forward. </p>

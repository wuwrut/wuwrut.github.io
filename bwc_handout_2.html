<p>My Dear McTavish</p>

<p>I wish I knew where to begin. It appears my suspicions were correct, and
Blackwater Creek is indeed built upon the former site of Crade's Rest.
I have discovered artifacts that give every indication of an early Colonial
settlement <strike>and remains which</strike>. There is so much more here, though,
<strike>so much more than I hear my mother sometimes. I know her voice. She's
dead, but I hear her</strike>.</p>

<p>The cave is not just a myth. Cade tried to bury it, <strike>but she's there and she
neve died</strike>.</p>

<p>I have procured some dynamite and I aim to open up the cave as soon as this
damnable storm ends. <strike>Even the wind sounds like her.</strike></p>

<p><strike>She need me. I must free her. God forgive me.</strike></p>

<h3>Papers Stolen from Home of Professor Arkham</h3>

<p>Police are investigating a break-in at the residence of one of Miskatonic University's leading professors.
The home of Professor Stanley David was broken into last night, with the culprit entering the professor's study
and making off with a number of papers that the professor was working on. </p>

<p>"I just don't understand why anyone would want these papers!" Said Professor David.
"It's just a translation of an ancient text that I'm working on and has no financial value.
Perhaps the hapless thief mistook the papers for something else. Well he'll get a shock when he reads them!" Laughed the professor.</p>

<p>Police are asking anybody who might have been about South Garrison Street last night between midnight and 2 a.m. to come
forward if they saw anything suspicious. </p>

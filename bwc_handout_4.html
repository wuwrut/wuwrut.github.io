<h1>From Myths and Legends of Old Massachusetts</h1>

<h3>by Oliver Stansfield</h3>

<p>One less sinister and undoubtedly less puzzling mystery of the Miskatonic Valley is the fate of the settlement known as Cade's Rest. </p>

<p>Historical record shows that following the hanging of Mary Dyer on Boston Common in 1620, a group of Quakers left Boston, fearing persecution at the hands of the Puritans. This group was led by the tailor Ezekiel Cade, and included as many as ten other families. Aft
er some months of travel, they settled by the banks of the Miskatonic River, not far from the spot that would one day become Dunwich.</p>

<p>While records from this point are scant, the folk story holds that the settlement thrived once Cade and his followers made contact with a local Indian tribe known as the People of the Black Earth.</p>

<p>Where the tale turns to folklore is in the demise of the settlement. Some stories have the earth opening and swallowing the settlers' whole. Others tell of them being snatched away by the Devil himself. Even the more mundane details are contradictory, with some desc
ribing the discovery of empty homes on the site, and others saying that even the buildings had vanished.</p>

<p>Given that there are mentions of Cade being spotted in Boston a few years later, the most likely explanation is that the settlers simply moved again, possibly spreading the rumours of their disappearance themselves to secure their privacy. Alternatively, they may ha
ve come into conflict with the Black Earth tribe and been killed. Regardless of the truth, the legend is a minor one at best. </p>

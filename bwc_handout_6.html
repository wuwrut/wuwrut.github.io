<h1>Summary of The Confessions of Ezekiel Cade</h1>

<p>Cade starts by discussing the threat to the Quakers presented by the Puritans in Boston in 1660 and his decision to lead his family and friends to find somewhere they could live in peace. </p>

<p>They headed north, up the coast and eventually followed the Miskatonic River inland, finally stopping when they reached some fertile land at the base of a range of hills. They set up a small settlement there, away from civilisation, and lived peacefully for months b
efore meeting the Sicaiook or Black Earth tribe.</p>

<p>Initially, Cade's followers and the Sicaiook coexisted amicably. The Sicaiook were shunned by all the local tribes, and the Quakers were the first people they encountered who would trade with them. In exchange, when Cades son, Daniel, was gored by a stag when huntin
g, the Sicaiook took him to their sacred cave to be healed.</p>

<p>Daniel wasn't the same when he returned, though, claiming that he had seen the Devil. While his would was healed, he sickened in other ways, growing mad and violent. When Cade asked the Sicaiook what they had done to his son, they took him to the cave and showed him
 their elders. Cades narrative becomes incoherent at this point, mentioning demons made flesh and abominations in the earth. He fears that they have corrupted all they have touched, and not even those who are strong in their faith are safe.</p>

<p>In the following section, Cade admits that, maddened, he fled the valley and vanished for several months. His faith and his desire to live by peace failed him, and he resolved to do what needed to be done to contain the corruption.In time, he returned to the settlem
ent, bringing a boat up the river, bearing hired guns and barrels of gunpowder. To the horror of those who had once looked up to him, he fed the destruction of the Sicaiook, and used the gunpowder to collapse the cave. He then ordered his mercenaries to turn on his own
 people, knowing them to be tainted, and burned all the bodies together. </p>

<p>In time, Cade returned to Boston. His narrative degenerates again, as he starts believing that the taint of the settlement has come to Boston with him, in his flesh. He was forced to shun human company, gaining a reputation as a leper, and resolved to leave Boston a
nd live out his days in seclusion. His narrative ends with a plea for forgiveness from God, from his family and from those he murdered. </p>

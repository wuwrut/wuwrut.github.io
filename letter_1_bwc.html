<p>CIO Baxter's Central Goods,
Blackwater Creek,
Dunwich County </p>

<p>June 22nd, 1928 </p>

<p>My Dear McTavish</p>

<p>I am very sorry to inform you that 1 have been unavoidably delayed in my plans to return to the university. While, as we have discussed in the past, the dig site has proved fruitless, there is still some minor work to be carried out before I can extricate myself from the area. I do anticipate returning to Arkham by the end of August at the latest. Again, please accept my deepest apologies for the inconve-nience that this extension may cause.</p>

<p>In case you are considering sending any members of the field team back to the site, I would recommend against this in the strongest possible terms. As you have probably heard before, it saddens me to say that one of the local farmers has taken a strong dislike to ou
r presence here, and he seems to have some rough associates. While the field team consists of Abigail and me, we probably represent sufficiently little intrusion to be objectionable, but I am sorry to say that an increase in numbers may prove provocative.</p>

<p>Abigail sends her love, and we both look for ward to returning to Arkham and joining you and Mary for a bridge evening as soon as we can. I am so very sorry. </p>

<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Henry</p>

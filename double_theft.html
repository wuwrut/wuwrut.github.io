<h3>Double Theft</h3>

<p>A shocking double robbery occurred last night at the Miskatonic University, with both the Library and the Museum being broken
into and rare artifacts stolen. Police and university authorities believe the thefts to have taken place between 8:00 pm and 5:00 am,
however no word has come forth on whether the two robberies are connected.</p>

<p>Archibold Pringler, a spokesman for the Vice Principal's Office, confirmed that an ancient Greek scroll was missing from the library
and that a Native American dagger was also missing from the museum. Both items are said to hold great academic
significance yet little financial value. </p>
